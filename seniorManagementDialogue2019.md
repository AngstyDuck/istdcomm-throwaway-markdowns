### Q: From the ISTD seniors, I have heard that the classes are more packed with less faculty to student ratio. Is it possible to reshuffle the faculty ratio for ISTD pillar?

ISTD had increased the number of classes and faculty loads for popular subjects such as 50.004 Introduction to Algorithms (to 4), 01.112 Machine Learning (to 3) and 50.021 Artificial Intelligence (to 3). Taken note of the overwhelming response received for 50.043 Database and Big Data which is being offered the first time in Fall 2019, ISTD decided to add one more class to this subject next year, 2 faculty members will be teaching this course. For each old course, we use past years’ responses to gauge students’ interest. Should the student number for any ISTD course increases (to a substantial number), ISTD will increase the number of classes.

On the other hand, ISTD does survey before the start of every Term 6, 7 and 8 to find out what courses are the students interested to take. This approach helps us with the course planning and faculty assignments. However, we are aware of the following challengers faced and are managing them at the best we can.

 - Not all students will complete such surveys, some are unsure of the courses they would like to take for the subsequent term. For the last survey, we only received responses from 65% of the entire cohort.
- Some students changed their minds and end up taking a different set of courses and not those which they indicated in surveys.

(Note: The Pillar does not want to set hard and fast rules on this as that is going to take away the course selection flexibility that we offer to students currently)
